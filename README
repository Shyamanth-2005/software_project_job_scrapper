## JobFunnel Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and run JobFunnel to search for job listings across multiple platforms.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install JobFunnel

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/PaulMcInnis/JobFunnel.git
```

### 2. Download Configuration

```bash
python -c "import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://git.io/JUWeP', 'my_settings.yaml')"
```

### 3. Run JobFunnel

```bash
funnel load -s my_settings.yaml
```

## What is JobFunnel?

JobFunnel is a tool that aggregates job listings from multiple job search platforms into a single, manageable interface. It helps you:

- Search across multiple job boards simultaneously
- Filter and organize job listings
- Avoid duplicate applications
- Track your job search progress

## Configuration

The `my_settings.yaml` file contains all the configuration settings for your job search. You can customize:

- **Search queries**: Job titles, keywords, locations
- **Platforms**: Which job sites to search (Indeed, Monster, etc.)
- **Filters**: Salary range, experience level, date posted
- **Output format**: How results are saved and organized

### Editing Settings

After downloading the configuration file, you can edit `my_settings.yaml` to match your preferences:

```yaml
# Example settings structure
search:
  query: "software engineer"
  location: "San Francisco, CA"
  radius: 25 # miles

filters:
  salary_min: 80000
  experience_level: ["mid", "senior"]

platforms:
  indeed: true
  monster: true
  glassdoor: true
```

## Usage

After the initial setup, you can run JobFunnel with your custom settings:

```bash
funnel load -s my_settings.yaml
```

The tool will:

1. Scrape job listings from configured platforms
2. Apply your filters and deduplicate results
3. Save the results to a local database or file
4. Provide a summary of found listings

## Output

JobFunnel typically outputs:

- A CSV or JSON file with job listings
- Console summary of search results
- Optional: Web interface for browsing jobs

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure you have a stable internet connection
- Check that your `my_settings.yaml` file is in the current directory
- Verify Python and pip are properly installed
- Some job platforms may require API keys or have rate limits

---

**Note**: Always respect job platforms' terms of service and rate limits when using web scraping tools.
